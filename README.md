I'm an **Front-end Engineer 🖥** with a strong background in **software architecture 🏛** and **UX 👨‍🎨**. I've been working with the web for more then **15** years, and will work until I die with the web, becase I know you always bet on JavaScript. 

Currently I'm writting a book about **Vue.js 3.0** for **Packt Publishing** that will be released on 2020.

I work at [**Kovi**🚘](https://www.kovi.com.br/), bringing to life new crazy stuff and big projects, based in **Vue.js**, **Quasar Framework**, **graphQL**, **TypeScript** and **Serverless Framework**.
