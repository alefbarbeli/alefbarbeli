### Hi there 👋 I'm Heitor Ramon :octocat:

A **Front-end Engineer** 🖥 with a strong background in **software architecture 🏛** and **UX 👨‍🎨**. I've been working with the web for more than **15** years and will work until I die with the internet because I know you always bet on JavaScript. 

Currently, I'm writing a book about **Vue.js 3.0** for **Packt Publishing** that will release in 2020.

I work at [**Kovi**🚘](https://www.kovi.com.br/), bringing to life new crazy stuff and big projects, based in **Vue.js**, **Quasar Framework**, **graphQL**, **TypeScript** and **Serverless Framework**.
