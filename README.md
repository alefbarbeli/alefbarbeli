### Hi there, 👋 I'm Heitor Ramon :octocat:

A **Front-end Engineer** 🖥 with a strong background in **software architecture 🏛** and **UX 👨‍🎨**. I've been working with the web for more than **15** years and will do until I die with the internet because I know you always bet on JavaScript. 

I wrote two books about JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, Quasar-Framework, AWS and Frontend Development: 
 - **Vue.js 3 Cookbook** [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LlqMUU)
 - **Building Vue.js Applications with GraphQL** [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XcB24r)

I'm currently working at [**Kovi**🚘](https://www.kovi.com.br/), bringing to life new crazy stuff and big projects, based in **Vue.js**, **Quasar Framework**, **graphQL**, **TypeScript** and **Serverless Framework**.
